# Linear Graphing Calculator
This projects simpily calculate line of best fit from inputted data and plot it with `matplotlib`. This is also one of my earilest Python projects which let me experience the python environment.

It features:
- 2D user input data 
- matplotlib for data visulization in form of graphs
- finding the line of best fit from given dataset

## Get Started
Make sure `matplotlib` is installed or do:
```
For window, simply double-click on `linear_graphing_calculator.py`. For Unix or MacOS, run
```
python linear_graphing_calculator.py
```
